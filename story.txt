One day, I was at the schloss at the top of the hill for some doener.
I was parched looking for something to drink when I stumbled upon the biergarten.
After the biergarten I jumped into my Porsche, but was safe by driving like a Schildkrote.
Then a driver in a BMW started to get wettbeswerbsfaehig and wanted to race to the nearby Schloss.
So I told him "Whoever wins will have to get Bratwurst for all the people in Hauptstrasse"
Then we will head over to the Flughafen in Rammstein.
We peeled off through the countryside, racing neck and neck while I ate my Apfelkuchen dessert.
After a very close race, the dust settled on our tires in the outskirts of Eltz declaring me the winner - the giver of bratwurst.
The bratwurst was so tasty we felt it was necessary to swap lederhose.
But he ended up looking like a confused Oktoberfest tourist in mine, which were several sizes too klein!
My hund, who is a german shepard, was wearing a dirndel.
I gave my hund a delicious slice of brot.
